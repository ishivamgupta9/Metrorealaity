        <p className="about-text">
          As a land developer for the last 10 years within the state of Maryland, we've built up to 5 custom homes in Baltimore and Howard County. We have gone from subdivision to Certificate of Occupancy (COO), and during this journey, we realized the local energy sectors are not caught up with the latest green initiatives. We've delved deep into land subdivision, geothermal, and solar power energy solutions that are balanced with a return on investment within less than 7 years.
        </p>
        <p className="about-text">
          In our recent builds, we consulted with big-box stores and reviewed the best home automation and security applications. While these applications are capable of meeting our needs, our research and optimization efforts allow us to lower costs and build much better solutions for everyday use.
